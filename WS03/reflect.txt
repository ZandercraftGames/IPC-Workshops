Workshop 2

    1. Mapping the month integer to the month name can be achieved using either a case-switch construct,
       as I used in this program, or an "if, else if" chain. The benefit of using the case-switch is that
       it is based on one condition and you do not have to re-write that condition for each case.

       --- Case-Switch ---
       switch (month) {
            case 1:
               monthName = "JAN";
               break;
            case 2:
               monthName = "FEB";
               break;

            . . .
            default:
                printf("*error message here*");
       }

       --- If, Else If ---
       if (month = 1) {
          monthName = "JAN";
       } else if (month = 2) {
          monthName = "FEB";
       } . . .
       else {
           printf("*error message here*");
       }

    2. The three types of iteration constructs are while loops, for loops and do-while loops.
       I used a while loop for my validation routines because it will run until a condition is
       met. This allows for running infinitely and only when the condition is met does it stop
       running. A do-while loop could probably also work for this though.

    3. To test the program, I went through testing each error/failure case as well as testing
       entries that are supposed to be accepted at and around the limits. Through a couple of runs,
       some tweaking and formatting changes, I found the program to be complete. Beyond that, I also
       made sure to test every path in the code that the program could go down, such as an incorrect
       entry for morning, then a correct one for morning when re-prompted followed by an incorrect one
       for evening and a correct entry for evening. This process was carried out for each entry required
       by the program.
