Workshop 6

1. The ReportData structure takes up 60 bytes in memory. The passing of the ReportData structure could be improved by
always using a pointer to the original variable instead of copies of the variable in all the functions. This would mean
that any use of that particular variable in functions would reference a single location in memory instead of the multiple.

2. The ReportData structure could be improved by including a pointer to the CatFoodInfo variable that it is
linked to. This would prevent the duplication of the data. See the following:
```
struct ReportData
{
    struct CatFoodInfo *item;
    double weightKG;     // Product weight in kilograms.
    int    weightG;      // Product weight in grams. (whole number)
    double servings;     // Number of total servings.
    double servingCost;  // Cost per serving.
    double caloriesCost; // Cost of calories per serving.
};
```

Use in displayReportData:
```
printf("%07d %10.2lf %10.1lf %10.4lf %9d %8d %8.1lf %7.2lf %7.5lf%3s\n", data.*item.sku, data.*item.price, data.*item.weight,
    data.weightKG, data.weightG, data.*item.calories, data.servings, data.servingCost, data.caloriesCost,
    isCheapestOption ? " ***" : "");
```
